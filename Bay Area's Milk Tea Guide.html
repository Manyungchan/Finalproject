<h3>
  The owner of this website is very into trying new bubble tea places. She listed Kung Fu Tea, Fengcha, Happy Lemon, Royal Tea and Boba Guys as all her top five favorite milk tea places. Each boba shop has her recommended drink on the page. She hopes to help people who have the same interest as her to treat this website as a guide if they ever come to the bay area and wonder what places have good bubble teas. She wants to have her own shop one day, designing the interior and exterior of the cafe all by herself, from decoration to business. If you are reading this and have any suggestions to add on the list. Feel free to email her right here at the bottom.
