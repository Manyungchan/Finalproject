  <p> Strawberry Overload
    <br>
   This is a very refreshing drink! Especially in the summer, the decoration inside is really cute. It is insanely Instagram famous, even one of the Warriors' members went to this place. I knew this place from Instagram. I stopped by Newark when I was coming back to my house from Concord. They have sea salt boba cake, matcha cake, and strawberry cake. I ordered a sea salt boba cake and it was perfect with this strawberry overload. It had a nice balance between both desserts. It has bits of real strawberry inside the drink. The drink's amount is not bad for the price.
