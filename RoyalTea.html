  <p> Brown Sugar Creme Brulee Boba Milk
    <br>
   This is a very famous drink from Royal Tea. It is constanly sold out because it is limited serving on every Friday only. I was lucky enough to tried it a while ago and I love it. The top has a layer of Creme Brulee, which gives it a burnt, caramel sweet smell.
