<p> Oreo Wow with Milk cap
  <br>
 The consistency of this bubble tea is smooth, creamy and tasty. The sweetness from the boba balance the lactose free milk. The oreo crumbs add more texture to the drink, making it taste magical from the first sip. It is one of the top selling drinks at Kung Fu Tea in the San Jose location. I was almost obssesed with this drink after I tried it once. It is very addictive so be careful.
